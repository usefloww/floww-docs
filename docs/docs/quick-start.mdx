Get started with Floww in under 5 minutes. Build your first workflow and deploy it to production.

## Create a New Project

Use the `floww init` command to create a new project:

```bash
npx floww init
```

This will:
- Create a new project directory
- Set up the necessary files (`main.ts`, `package.json`, etc.)
- Install dependencies automatically

Then navigate to your project:

```bash
cd my-workflow  # or whatever name you chose
```

## Your First Workflow

Edit the `main.ts` file created by `floww init`:

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { Builtin } from "floww";

const builtin = new Builtin();

builtin.triggers.onCron({
  expression: "*/1 * * * * *",
  handler: (ctx, event) => {
    console.log("Do this every second", event.scheduledTime);
  },
});
```

## Run in Development

Start the development server:

```bash
floww dev
```

**What happens:**
- Your triggers are registered on the Floww server
- Events are routed to your local machine for execution
- Your code hot-reloads when you make changes
- Logs appear in your terminal in real-time

You should see a new log line every second as the cron trigger fires.

## Try a Webhook

Let's add a webhook trigger to handle HTTP requests. Update your `main.ts`:

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { Builtin } from "floww";

const builtin = new Builtin();

// Cron trigger - runs every second
builtin.triggers.onCron({
  expression: "*/1 * * * * *",
  handler: (ctx, event) => {
    console.log("Cron triggered at", event.scheduledTime);
  },
});

// Webhook trigger - responds to HTTP requests
builtin.triggers.onWebhook({
  path: "/hello",
  handler: (ctx, event) => {
    console.log("Webhook received:", event.body);
    return {
      message: "Hello from Floww!",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  },
});
```

When you run `floww dev`, you'll get a webhook URL like:
```
✓ Webhook registered: https://app.usefloww.dev/webhook/w_abc123/hello
```

Test it with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://app.usefloww.dev/webhook/w_abc123/hello \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "World"}'
```

## Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
floww deploy
```

**What happens:**
- Your TypeScript code is bundled
- Code is uploaded to Floww cloud
- Infrastructure is provisioned automatically
- You receive production webhook URLs

Your workflow will now run in the cloud, handling events 24/7.
