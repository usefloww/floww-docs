Debugging is a key advantage of code first workflows.

To debug a workflow, you can use the `floww dev --debug` which will allow 
for breakpoints to be set in the user code and for the inspector to be used to debug the workflow.


## VS Code

To attach the debugger in VS Code, you will have to
- Open the command palette and run `Debug: Attach to Process`
