title: Custom Runtimes
---

Custom runtimes allow for installing arbitrary packages and dependencies in the runtime of your workflow.
Runtimes in floww are built on top of Docker images so they are fully customizable.

## How to use

To use a custom runtime, you will have to create a Dockerfile that installs the dependencies you need.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM ghcr.io/usefloww/lambda-runtime

COPY package.json /app/package.json
RUN npm install
```

When running `floww deploy`, the Dockerfile will automatically be built and used for the deployment.


:::warning
The `Dockerfile` will be used when deploying the workflow but not when running floww locally.
