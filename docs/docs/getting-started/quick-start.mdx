import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';


Every workflow lives inside of its own folder so to get started we
recommend creating a new folder anywhere to your liking

```bash
mkdir example-floww && cd example-floww
```

## Installation

Installation can be done by installing the `floww-sdk` package with your favorite package manager.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install floww-sdk" />

## Your First Workflow


Create a new file called `main.ts` and start running
```bash
touch main.ts
```

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { getProvider } from "floww";

const builtin = getProvider("builtin");

builtin.triggers.onCron({
  expression: "*/1 * * * * *",
  handler: (ctx, event) => {
    console.log("Do this every second", event.scheduledTime);
  },
});
```

## Run Your Workflow

```bash
floww dev
```

This should immediately start printing some logs to the screen
with a new log line every second as the cron timer is being triggered.


## Deploy Your Workflow

```bash
floww deploy
```

This will host your workflow
